  <h2>Today we will be taking about primate conservation.</h2>
  <img width="900" src="Primates.jpg" />
  <h3>The reasons we need to be worried about primate conservation are as follows:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Primates serve as a key functions for the environment they inhabit. This includes a key part in regeneration of
      the rain forest. </li>
    <li> Primates provide a unique insight into human evolution.</li>
    <li> Primates are an umbrella species.This means that in order to stop their extinction the entire rain forest must
      also be conserved. Therefore their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem. </li>
    <li> 10 percent of the worlds species live in the rain forest. </li>
    <li> Most importantly the rain forest produces a vast amount of oxygen for our planet.</li>
    <p> It is also important to note that the rain forest floor stores a vast amount of carbon. This reduces the amount
      of carbon going into our atmosphere. However, when the forest is burned down this releases that carbon storage
      into the atmosphere.</p>
  </ol>
  <h3> Why is the rain forest being cut down?</h3>
  <p> Most of the rain forest are being cut down in order to make more space for production. Due to the growing
    population and the growing demand for resources space needs to be cleared. The forests are being cut down for palm
    plantations, sugar cane, cattle, etc. However, the rain forest floor is actually nutrient poor. This means that when
    it is used for production it is quickly depleted of those vital nutrients needed for crops or grass. Therefore, more
    forest is needed to cut down in order to continue production and leave the old land to turn to a desert. </p>


  <h3>The primates that are closest to extinction:</h3>
  <ul>
    <p> 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction.</p>
    <li> Aye-Aye</li>
    <li> Rondo Dwarf Galago</li>
    <li> Colobus Monkeys</li>
    <li> Western Chimpanzee</li>
    <li> Javan Slow Loris</li>
    <li> Langur</li>
    <li> Gaoligong Hoolock Gibbon</li>
    <li> Tapanuli Orangutan</li>
    <li> Brown Howler Monkey</li>
    <li> Spider Monkey</li>

    <p> The List goes on...</p>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why do I care about rain forest and Primate conservation?</strong></p>
  <p> I realized when I was very young that a lot of the species I have known to love might not exist in the next 10, 5
    or even 2 years.It really upset me that I had been going about my day unaware of the catastrophe. Soon I found out
    that the forests were illegally being cut down as hundreds of animals were being killed in the blaze. It baffled me
    that such a thing could be happening with no regard for future generations or our planet. I decided that I would
    always keep my finger on the pulse of conservation and do what I can to help no matter how big or small.
